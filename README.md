# advent Of Code 2015
Series of small programming puzzles.

http://adventofcode.com/

To run the command:

```javascript
    $ ruby xxxx.rb
```

For some puzzles, you can pass parameter "2" to run the second part of the puzzle:

```javascript
    $ ruby xxxx.rb 2
```

I was always wondering: should I write a minimum line of codes (at a cost to lose readability)? Should I trust the input? For example, will the input file contains only "<>^v"?
